Problem description:
write a program to implement a solution for the problem described in assign4a.
requirements:
   1. use POSIX semaphores (semaphore.h) and threads (pthreads). 
   2. do not use shared memory.
   3. use pthread mutexes to protect critical sections not binary semaphores.
   4. use state machine diagrams to design program to implement a solution for this problem
